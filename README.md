## Features

- **5-step form flow**: Personal Info → Professional Info → Education → Preferences → Review & Submit
- **Per-step validation** with inline error messages (required fields, email/phone format, min length)
- **Custom hook** (`useMultiStepForm`) for state, validation, and navigation
- **Progress bar & stepper** – visual progress and clickable steps (back only)
- **LocalStorage** – form data is saved as you type; survives page refresh
- **Review step** with “Edit” buttons to jump back to any previous step
- **Success screen** with animated checkmark and option to submit again
- **Responsive layout** – works on mobile and desktop
- **No extra form libraries** – pure React and CSS

## Tech Stack

- **React** 19
- **Vite** 7
- **ESLint** (React hooks + refresh)

## Form Steps Overview

| Step | Screen           | Main fields / actions                                      |
|------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Personal Info    | First name, last name, email, phone, date of birth        |
| 2    | Professional     | Company, role, experience (dropdown), skills (multi-select) |
| 3    | Education        | Degree, university, graduation year, GPA (optional)         |
| 4    | Preferences       | Theme, communication, newsletter, short bio (min 20 chars) |
| 5    | Review & Submit  | Read-only summary + Edit per section, Submit button         |

After submit, a success screen is shown with an option to start over (“Submit Another Response”).

## How It Works (High Level)

1. **App.jsx** uses the `useMultiStepForm(5)` hook and gets `currentStep`, `formData`, `errors`, `nextStep`, `prevStep`, `submitForm`, etc.
2. **Stepper** shows the 5 steps; completed steps are clickable to go back.
3. **Current step** is rendered by a `switch` on `currentStep` (PersonalInfo, ProfessionalInfo, … ReviewSubmit).
4. **Continue** runs validation for the current step; if valid, it moves to the next step.
5. **Submit** (on step 5) validates again, sets submitted state, and shows **SuccessScreen**.
6. **Form data** is updated via `updateField` and synced to localStorage in the hook.
